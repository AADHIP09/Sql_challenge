# Sql_challenge

The task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project, the goal is to design various tables to hold the data from the CSV files(data modeling), import the CSV files into a SQL database(data engineering), and then answer questions about the data(data analysis). 

## Data Modeling
Inspect the CSV files, and then sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables. To create the sketch, QuickDBDLinks was used.

## Data Engineering
  > Using the provided information, table schema was created for each of the six CSV files.

  > Each CSV file was imported into its corresponding SQL table.

## Data Analysis

The following Data Analysis tasks were completed: 
 > List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

 > List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

 > List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

 > List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

 > List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

 > List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

 > List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

 > List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
